# Android-Cool_Calculator
This is the first Android app I made without the use of a tutorial. It's a plain ol' calculator for Android. My previous Java calculator was a help with the basic functionality. I created the app to learn more about creating programs in the Android environment and discover how to implement features I'll need in my future apps.
